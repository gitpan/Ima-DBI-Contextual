2012-03-02    v1.002
  - After extensive use in forked/threaded environments, some problems began to appear.
  - This release addresses these problems:
    "DBD driver has not implemented the AutoCommit attribute"
    "DBD::mysql::db do failed: MySQL server has gone away"
  - Major shout-out to Perrin for solving most of this several years ago.

2011-06-05    v1.001
  - Deprecated commit and rollback methods.

2011-06-01    v1.000
  - After a year of solid performance, I'm giving Ima::DBI::Contextual a 1.0 version number.
  - Removed warnings that look like this:
    "Issuing rollback() due to DESTROY without explicit disconnect()..."
  - The warnings were caused when the db connection has gone away and we reconnect.
  - No other changes.
